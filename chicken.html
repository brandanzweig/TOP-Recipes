<h4>What is Anthony's Chicken?</h4>
<p>Lightly breaded chicken breast covered with a honey mustard barbeque sauce 
   containing chopped bacon, diced tomatoes and onions. 
   This dish is baked over pasta topped with Monterey Jack cheese.</p>
<h4>Some Ingridients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound dry penne pasta</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
    </ul>   
<h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of 
            lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes
            or until al dente; drain. Transfer to a deep 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk. Season with salt and 
            pepper. 
            Dip the chicken breasts in the egg mixture, then roll in bread crumbs to 
            coat. 
            Heat the olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Fry chicken breasts until the juices run clear, and they are well browned
            on both sides. Remove to paper towels to drain. 
            Drain excess oil from the chicken pan, leaving it coated.</li>
    </ol>
